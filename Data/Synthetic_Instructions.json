The film follows patriarch Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), head of the family as he builds his criminal empire with help from his sons Michael (Al Pacino) and Fredo (John Cazale). With themes that explore morality and loyalty, The Godfather tells a story of power struggles within organized crime while portraying an intimate look at familial relationships amongst these dangerous characters. At its heart, the film is about how people navigate between their personal desires and moral obligations while meeting expectations of tradition and heritage within society's confines of lawful behavior.."

At first it appears to be successful \"animal socialism\" but as time goes on , power becomes exploitative leading to consequences like corruption,murder and overall oppression of other animals who aren't part of ruling class. The novel elucidates how absolute power corrupts absolutely, through observing how principles are deliberately silenced or violated for furtherance of personal interests. With belief in equality failing each time someone comes into power regardless whether individuals were at base humans or animals .. The novel serves as warning against potential dangers posed by unchecked authoritarianism which can resurface anytime in any society."
